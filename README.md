# Overview
**Braq** (pronounced `/ˈbɹæk/`) is a human-readable data format whose reference parser is an eponymous lightweight [Python](https://www.python.org/) library available on [PyPI](#installation).

> Along with [Paradict](https://github.com/pyrustic/paradict), Braq is a spin-off of [Jesth](https://github.com/pyrustic/jesth).


A Braq document is made up of **sections**, each defined by a **header** surrounded by square brackets (hence the name Braq) and a **body** which is just lines of text. 

Instead of interpreting the lines that make sections, the Braq parser lays low and lets the programmer decide what to do with them.

Because of this parsing policy, a single Braq document can contain an **eclectic set of sections** such as a poem, server configs, help text, [prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) for a chatbot, [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph), [ascii artwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art), and more.

> The doc generator used for [Pyrustic](https://pyrustic.github.io) projects consumes docstrings written in Braq.

# Parse a document
The library exposes the `parse` function which takes as input the text stream to be parsed, then returns a dictionary whose keys and values are strings representing headers and bodies respectively.

> Sections sharing the same header are concatenated !

```python
import braq

text = """\
this is the unnamed section

[section 1]
this is section 1"""

r = braq.parse(text)
assert tuple(r.keys()) == ("", "section 1")
```

## Parse a document iteratively
A document can be parsed line by line as following:

```python
import braq

text = """\
this is the unnamed section

[section 1]
this is section 1"""

for header, body in braq.iter_parse(text):
    if header:
        print("[" + header + "]")
    for line in body:
        print(line)
```

Output:

```text
this is the unnamed section

[section 1]
this is section 1
```


<p align="right"><a href="#readme">Back to top</a></p>

# Read a file
The library exposes the `read` function which takes as input the path to a file to parse, then returns a dictionary whose keys and values are strings representing headers and bodies respectively.

> Sections sharing the same header are concatenated !

```python
import braq

path = "/home/alex/braqfile.txt"

r = braq.read(path)
assert tuple(r.keys()) == ("", "section 1")
```

## Read a file iteratively
A large text file can be parsed line by line as following:

```python
import braq

path = "/home/alex/braqfile.txt"

for header, body in braq.iter_read(path):
    if header:
        print("[" + header + "]")
    for line in body:
        print(line)
```
Output:

```text
this is the unnamed section

[section 1]
this is section 1
```

<p align="right"><a href="#readme">Back to top</a></p>

# Render a document
Rendering a document involves transforming Python objects representing sections into Braq text which is a string that can be displayed on the screen or stored in a file.

The library exposes the `render` function which accepts as input a sequence of sections (either header-body tuples or `Section` objects) and returns a Braq document.

```python
import braq

section_1 = braq.Section("section 1", "line a\nline b")
section_2 = "section 2", "line c\nline d"
section_3 = "section 3", ("line e", "line f")

r = braq.render(section_1, section_2, section_3)

print(r)
```

Output:

```text
[section 1]
line a
line b

[section 2]
line c
line d

[section 3]
line e
line f
```

> The render function also accepts the `spacing` argument which defaults to 1 and represents the number of lines of spacing between two adjacent sections.

# Write to file
Following is a snippet for writting a Braq document to a file:

```python
import braq

# sections
section_1 = braq.Section("", "welcome")
section_2 = braq.Section("section 2")
section_3 = "section 3", ("line a", "line b")
# path to file
path = "/home/alex/braqfile.txt"
# write to file
r = braq.write(section_1, section_2, section_3, dest=path)
```
The contents of the Braq file:
```text
welcome

[section 2]

[section 3]
line a
line b
```

<p align="right"><a href="#readme">Back to top</a></p>

# The Section class
The `Section` class is an abstraction representing a Braq section. It exposes the `header` and `body` properties and renders itself when its `__str__` method is called implicitly.

```python
import braq

header, body = "my header", ("line a", "line b")
section = braq.Section(header, body)

assert section.header == "my header"
assert section.body == "line a\nline b"
assert str(section) == """\
[my header]
line a
line b"""
```


<p align="right"><a href="#readme">Back to top</a></p>

# The Parser class
The `iter_parse` function under the hood uses the `Parser` class to parse Braq documents.


```python
import braq

doc = """\
welcome

[section 1]
line a
line b"""

parser = braq.Parser()
for header, body in parser.parse(doc):
    if header:
        print("[" + header + "]")
    for line in body:
        print(line)
```

Output:

```text
welcome

[section 1]
line a
line b
```

# Misc functions
The `check_header` function accepts a line of text as input and then returns a boolean to indicate whether this line is a header or not.

```python
import braq

line_1 = "[my header]"
line_2 = "[this isn't a header] at all"
assert braq.check_header(line_1) is True
assert braq.check_header(line_2) is False
```

The `get_header` function accepts a line of text as input and returns a string if the line is a header. Otherwise, `None` is returned.

```python
import braq

line_1 = "[my header]"
line_2 = "[this isn't a header] at all"
assert braq.get_header(line_1) == "my header"
assert braq.get_header(line_2) is None
```
